# Challenge 08 - REPL

## Challenge Overview

Make your own Python REPL, complete with variable retention and convenience features like using arrow keys to navigate previous entries.

## Restrictions

You should not use the `eval`, `exec`, `compile` built-ins. You also shouldn't use the `code`, `codeop` or `py_compile` modules. Please try not to use anything that's very similar to these tools either, as it will probably make the challenge too easy. We're looking for novel approaches to executing Python code.

## Submissions Guidelines

* Submit your code as a python file named `<yourname>.py` in the `solutions` directory. If your implementation is too big or you simply prefer splitting the code into several files, submit a directory named `<yourname>` with the code inside. See the `README.md` file in the root of the repository for more information on contributing solutions.

Happy Hacking ❤️ Shawn (aka Zhawn) and Juanita
