# Challenge 07 - Code Art

## Challenge Overview

Your submission doesn't have to do anything in particular for this challenge, it just has to do *something*. The complexity of the program is entirely up to you. However, the restriction this time is that the code itself must be some form of ASCII art (and the art is up to you as well).

This challenge is incredibly open-ended, so I hope there will be some very unique submissions. Don't forget, there is no time limit or deadline. Feel free to make it as complex and wonderful as you'd like. :D

### Examples

This example was written by [Pastebean](https://github.com/aaay-aaay), and simply outputs "hello world":

```py
p   = print ;     s     =' ';\
h   = 'h    '     ;     r   =\
'rep' 'lac' ;     r     =   r\
+   r [     1     ]     ;   (\
)   ; eval( 'p('+ '"hell o".'\
\
+   r +('(" "     ,     "")+'\
)   + '     "     "     [   0\
]+"wo rld". '     +     r   +\
'   ( "     "     [     0   ]\
,   " "*0))');1+1 +1+1+ 1+1+1
```

If you can't make it out, the code itself looks like "HELLO" twice. Cool, right?
Another example is [Martmists'](https://github.com/martmists) submission for Challenge 05 (Text Hearts), where the code was shaped like a heart and also printed an ASCII heart.

## Restrictions

There are no restrictions. If you really want a challenge, try to avoid using pointless "filler" code to make your art look better. Don't worry though, if you do have to put in filler code, your submission will still be accepted. :)

## Submissions Guidelines

* Submit your code as a python file named `<yourname>.py` in the `solutions` directory. If your implementation is too big or you simply prefer splitting the code into several files, submit a directory named `<yourname>` with the code inside. See the `README.md` file in the root of the repository for more information on contributing solutions.

Happy Hacking ❤️ Shawn (aka Zhawn) and Juanita
