# Challenge 09 - Lolcat

## Challenge Overview

Sticking with this month's theme of LGBTQ+ pride and rainbows, the challenge today is to recreate a fun little program called `lolcat`. If you're unsure what that is, don't worry. It works the same way as the `cat` program does on Linux: when given a file name, it simply outputs the contents of the file. However, the cute difference with `lolcat` is that it puts the text through a spicy rainbow filter.

The esoteric challenge this time will be focused on golfing, but as always, please feel free to provide other unique or interesting esoteric submissions if you wish! :D

### Examples

Here is an example of what the program should do. In this example, `zen.txt` is given as a command-line argument and refers a regular text file, but you may also read text from input too.

## Restrictions

You should try to avoid imports, but you will probably not be penalised either way. :)

## Submissions Guidelines

* Submit your code as a python file named `<yourname>.py` in the `solutions` directory. If your implementation is too big or you simply prefer splitting the code into several files, submit a directory named `<yourname>` with the code inside. See the `README.md` file in the root of the repository for more information on contributing solutions.

Happy Hacking ❤️ Shawn (aka Zhawn) and Juanita
